Welcome!
This is a personal project made to learn about React 18 and Next.js 13 that added Server Components to its funcionality.
Next.js uses TailwindCSS as default style framework but went to declare my own styles in CSS to customize my project.
You may find some Redux logic that I'm currently adding to the project and how it hydrates between client and server components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
